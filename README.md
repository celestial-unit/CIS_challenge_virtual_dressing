## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **Advanced Clothing & Body Model Fusion**
  Seamlessly blend clothing items with body models for hyper-realistic virtual try-ons

- 🖼️ **Intelligent Image Generation**
  Utilize state-of-the-art latent diffusion models for controllable and precise outfit visualization

- 🧘 **Comprehensive Body Recognition**
  - Full-body and half-body outfit simulations
  - Precise human parsing and pose detection
  - Advanced garment segmentation and alignment

## 🔧 System Architecture

### 1. Computer Vision Recognition
- 2D body and clothing recognition
- Garment segmentation with pixel-perfect alignment
- Integration of cutting-edge datasets:
  - VITON-HD (Half-body)
  - Dress Code (Full-body)

### 2. Virtual Try-On Engine
- Intelligent clothing and body model pairing
- Advanced human parsing (OpenPose integration)
- Clothing category classification
- Realistic image synthesis using latent diffusion

### 3. Workflow Pipeline
```

```

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0.1
- OpenCV
- HuggingFace Transformers

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision torchaudio
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install opencv-python huggingface_hub
```

## 💡 Quick Start

```bash
# Basic Usage
python run_ootd.py \
  --model_path <model-image-path> \
  --cloth_path <cloth-image-path> \
  --scale 2.0 \
  --sample 4
```

### Example Output
- ✅ Generated Image: `<path-to-output-image>`
- 👗 Virtual Try-On: Enabled
- 🌈 Outfit Recommendation: Available

## 🚧 Limitations & Considerations

- Requires high-quality input images
- Model performance varies with body type and clothing style
- Image quality directly impacts output realism

## 🔮 Roadmap

### Upcoming Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced multi-body type recognition
- [ ] Real-time inference optimization
- [ ] Advanced outfit recommendation system
- [ ] Improved UI/UX design
